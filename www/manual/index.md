Welcome to Zed
==============

Welcome to Zed, a code editor built using web technologies, designed to rethink
some of the assumptions that underly most editors today. Some of the editor's
core features are the features it doesn't have:

* Tabs
* Always visible file tree
* Menus and buttons and bells and whistles

What get instead is a bare bones, simple editor that focusses on what matters
most: making you as productive at editing code and text as possible. To enable
this, Zed has:

* Multiple cursors. Once mastered, you will never edit code the same way again.
* Code completion based on symbols defined in your project, current file and
  snippets.
* Efficient project navigation at various levels of granularity:
    * Files, quickly jump to the file you want
    * Symbols, Zed indexes all symbols defined in your project and lets you
      quickly jump to the one you're interested in
* (Vertical) split views, either 1, 2 or 3 vertical splits.
* Auto-updating preview split for various languages (including markdown and
  coffeescript).
