Zed Cheatsheet
==============
Zed is heavily keyboard oriented, here are the keys you'll need to get started,
for more read the manual in the Manual project:

* `Command-E`/`Ctrl-E`: Open or create a new file. Inside the picker:
    * In an empty box, press space to complete the directory of the currently
      open document.
    * Press Up/Down or Tab/Shift-Tab to walk over results
    * Pressing return does different things in different situations:
        * When an item is selected, it will jump to the selected file
        * If no item is selected, it will create a new file with this path
* `Command-.`/`Ctrl-E`: Run an editor command.
* `Cmd-T`/`Alt-T`: Show file tree (useful for exploring projects you're
  not familiar with). Keys within the tree:
    * `Up`: Move up in the tree
    * `Down`: Move down in the tree
    * `Left`: Collapse node
    * `Right`: Expand node
    * `Enter`: Open file
* `Command-Shift-B`/`Ctrl-Shift-B`: Beautify the selected piece of (HTML, CSS,
  Javascript) code.
* `Command-1`/`Ctrl-1`: 1 split
* `Command-2`/`Ctrl-2`: 2 vertical splits (press repeatedly to cycle between
  split sizes)
* `Command-3`/`Ctrl-3`: 3 vertical splits
* `Command-P`/`Ctrl-P`: Preview split (press repeatedly to cycle between split
  sizes)
* `Command-0`/`Ctrl-0`: switch focus from one split to the next
