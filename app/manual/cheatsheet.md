Replace `Command` with `Ctrl` if you're not using a Mac.

* `Command-Shift-E` (Chrome global): open project picker.
* `Command-E`: To open or create a new file. Inside the picker:
    * In an empty box, press space to complete the directory of the currently open document.
    * Press slash (/) to complete the directory to the first match
    * Press Up/Down or Tab/Shift-Tab to walk over results
    * Pressing enter does different things in different situations:
        * When an item is selected, it will jump to the selected file
        * If no item is selected, it will create a new file with this path
* `Command-.`: Run an editor command.
* `Alt-T`: Show file tree (useful for exploring projects you're not familiar with).
   Keys within the tree:
    * `Up`: Move up in the tree
    * `Down`: Move down in the tree
    * `Left`: Collapse node
    * `Right`: Expand node
    * `Enter`: Open file
* `Command-Shift-B`: Beautify the selected piece of (HTML, CSS, Javascript) code.
* `Command-1`: 1 split
* `Command-2`: 2 vertical splits
* `Command-3`: 3 vertical splits
* `Command-P`: Preview split (only works for HTML and Markdown for now)
* `Command-0`: switch focus from one split to the next
* `Tab` (following an identifier): complete code. In completion mode:
    * `Tab`/`Up`: Select next completion
    * `Shift-Tab`/`Down`: Select previous completion
    * `Enter`: Pick selected completion
    * `Esc`: Close completion box
