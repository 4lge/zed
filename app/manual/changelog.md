Changelog
=========

0.7.2
-----
Improved project navigation. The project list can now be navigated using your keyboard: Use `Up` or `Shift-Tab` to go up and `Down` or `Tab` to go down in the list and `Enter` to open the selected project. Type in the filter box to filter the project list.

The project list can be brought up from any Zed editor window using the `Command-Shift-O`/`Ctrl-Shift-O` key quickly.

0.7.1
-----
Replaced goto filter box implementation with an ACE editor implementation which should be _substantially_ faster, especially in large projects.
