CTags
=====

CTags is an ancient format useful for code navigation and code completion.
Zed will look for a `tags` file in the root of your project and will keep it
up to date for the language that it supports (e.g. JavaScript, CSS, Go).

Keys: 

* `Command-R`: jump to a symbol within the current file
* `Command-J` jump to a symbol in the current project
* `Command-Shift-J`: jump to the symbol under the cursor searching for definitions
  within the current project.
