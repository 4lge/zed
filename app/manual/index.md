Welcome to Zed, the simple text editor. This manual, as you may have figured
is just yet another regular project, except all files are read only. You
navigate it much the same way as well: either use `Cmd-E` to see a list of all
files (topics), or put your cursor on a file path and press `Cmd-Shift-E` to
search for the file under the cursor.

Topics
------

* Key cheatsheet: cheatsheet.md
* Multiple cursors: cursors.md
* WebFS: webfs.md
