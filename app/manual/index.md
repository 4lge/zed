Zed: The Manual
===============

Welcome to Zed's manual. As you can probably tell, this manual is hosted in a
regular Zed window, although all files are read-only. You can use all regular
navigation keys to navigate this manual, for instance using `Command-E`/`Ctrl-E`
to open the goto box to quickly jump to a topic.

To quickly navigate to a help topic whose file name appears in the text,
put your cursor on the file name and press `Command-Shift-E`/`Ctrl-Shift-E`.
