            In order to know what Zed features to improve, we would like to collect
            <em>anonymous</em> information on what features of Zed you use. Since Zed
            is a 100% open source project, the findings of this research will be shared
            on <a href="http://zedapp.org" target="_blank">the Zed website</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            If, for whatever reason, you feel uncomfortable with this, you can disable
            this feature below. But we hope you don't, as this data really helps us.
            You can change this setting at any time in the Configuration project,
            the preference name is <tt>enableAnalytics</tt>.
        </p>

        <p><input type="checkbox" id="enable" checked> Sure, I'll help out by allowing automatic collection of <em>anonymous</em> usage data.</p>
